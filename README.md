# Plants-Recognition-CNN-Model
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for the project "Plant Recognition CNN Model" developed to assist the Jejak Karbon team in their capstone project for the Bangkit Program.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning/deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize and predict the types of plants based on the provided images. Accurate plant recognition has numerous applications, including environmental monitoring, biodiversity studies, and plant species identification.

Feel free to explore the notebooks to understand the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics used in this project. The trained models can be found in the models directory for direct usage or further experimentation.

This project was created to support the Jejak Karbon team in developing their capstone project application. If you are part of the Jejak Karbon team or are working on a similar project, you can adapt and enhance the code in this repository to meet your specific requirements.
